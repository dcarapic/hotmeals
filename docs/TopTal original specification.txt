Write an application for Food Delivery

    User must be able to create an account and log in. (If a mobile application, this means that more users can use the app from the same phone).
    Implement 2 roles with different permission levels
        * Regular User: Can see all restaurants and place orders from them
        * Restaurant Owner: Can CRUD restaurants and meals
    A Restaurant should have a name and description of the type of food they serve
    A meal should have a name, description, and price
    Orders consist of a list of meals, date, total amount and status
    An Order should be placed for a single Restaurant only, but it can have multiple meals
    Restaurant Owners and Regular Users can change the Order Status respecting below flow and permissions:
        * Placed: Once a Regular user places an Order
        * Canceled: If the Regular User cancel the Order
        * Processing: Once the Restaurant Owner starts to make the meals
        * In Route: Once the meal is finished and Restaurant Owner marks it’s on the way
        * Delivered: Once the Restaurant Owner receives information that the meal was delivered by their staff
        * Received: Once the Regular User receives the meal and marks it as Received
    Status should follow the sequence as stated above, and not allowed to move back
    Status can not be changed by a different user than is stated above
    Orders should have a history about the date and time of the status changing
    Both Regular Users and Restaurant Owners should be able to see a list of the orders

    Restaurant Owners have the ability to block a User
    REST/GraphQL API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication (If a mobile application and you don’t know how to create your own backend you can use Firebase.com or similar services to create the API).
    In any case, you should be able to explain how a REST/GraphQL API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST/GraphQL Layer directly. Please be prepared to use REST/GraphQL clients like Postman, cURL, etc. for this purpose.
    If it’s a web application, it must be a single-page application. All actions need to be done client-side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable. (If a mobile application, disregard this).
    Functional UI/UX design is needed. You are not required to create a unique design, however, do follow best practices to make the project as functional as possible.
    Bonus: unit and e2e tests.
